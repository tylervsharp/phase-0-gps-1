GPS 1.1

**What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**

The Git workflow and the workflow for using Git and GitHub together.

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**

Smaller details and gotchas on the syntax, the difference between git fetch, git merge, and git pull. Overall the Git/GitHub workflow makes more sense now that we have gone through the GPS.

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**

Syntax-related questions, order of items in the workflow, markdown file formatting, and merge conflict resolution.

**What still confuses you about Git?**

I just need more practice on the workflow to get more comfortable with it. Everything makes sense as concepts, but I need practice to get to know when to use certain things.

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**

Super positive experience. My pair was great and the guide did a great job of working together with us. She also went above and beyond to stay after to answer questions and help us grow.
